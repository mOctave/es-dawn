# es-dawn
A plugin for [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/) providing an alternate, and much earlier, storyline.
First version still in progress: I'll switch to using GitHub to work on it once it's done, but for now it is very buggy and incomplete.
Currently just getting everything set up. Read the [Contribution Guidlines](https://github.com/mOctave/es-dawn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to see how you can help.
